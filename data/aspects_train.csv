Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Avoid this place!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wine list is interesting and has many good values._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
I was very disappointed with this restaurant._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food was okay, nothing great._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I/we will never go back to this place again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!_1_0_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
You can't go wrong here._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Can't wait wait for my next visit._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.'_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
What's the difference between the two?_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
we love th pink pony._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
THe perfect spot._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food-awesome._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service- friendly and attentive._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..)_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the food is decent._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had a great experience._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food is great._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service is top notch._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have been going back again and again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The food was well prepared and the service impecable._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm going back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality)._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is terrific, as is the value._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Go hungry and enjoy._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The kitchen however, is almost always slow._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best._0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday._0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
IT WAS HORRIBLE._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pizza is overpriced and soggy._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A big disappointment, all around._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Worth the trip from Manhattan._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Was there Friday night._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And I've been to many NYC delis._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese._1_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
This place is worth an one-hour drive._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere._1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Decent wine at reasonable prices._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Our teenage kids love it, too._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm partial to the Gnocchi._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place is incredibly tiny._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was bland oily._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I just don't understand all the hype..._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We went to Ino for Valentines._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
When we sat, we got great and fast service._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Make sure you try this place as often as you can._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is a fun restaurant to go to._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
But the pizza is way to expensive._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I don't think I would go again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place is great._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was prompt, friendly and great._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Great pizza and fantastic service._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Located at the end of a magnificent block._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
Very cozy and warm inside....._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I will be back!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Get the tuna of gari._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too ._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored ._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down ._0_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
It's all about the food !!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I went there with my friend last saturday._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
first it took us a long time to find the place._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Try everything for that matter, it is all good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Much more reasonably priced too!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I take all my NYC guests to VT's._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service._0_0_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. ._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
it's delicious!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is also extremely well priced._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no..._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Such a disappointment..._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was prompt and courteous._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great service, great food._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
But too far east!_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
So eat fast and order a lot._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
fine dining restaurant quality._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Over 100 different choices to create your own._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A must try!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I grew up on these bagels._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The staff is no nonsense._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food options rule._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni. (_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite.)_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sake menu should not be overlooked!_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've never ordered anything else from their menu...there's no need to._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
It's simply the best meal in NYC._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The restaurant is cute but not upscale._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would highly recommend it._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Please take my advice, go and try this place._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Its located in greenewich village._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bagel was huge._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy)._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...)_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more)._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
This restaurant was way overhyped._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant._0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I definitely wouldn't go back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

It was wonderful._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Will give it another chance before I write it off._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation._0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
Salads were fantastic._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We will be back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each)._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place is always very crowded and popular._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Went here on a friend's reccomendation._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

sometimes i get good food and ok service._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
it is not consistent._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
really depends on your luck!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
And where does Patis go wrong; no where._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Overall I would recommend it and go back again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

It's a small cute restaurant._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I absolutely love this place!!!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

We were very disappointed._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We won't go to this place again for a good meal._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_0
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Check this place out!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_1
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc...._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Fish was overdone._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again._0_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

Will never be back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the waitstaffs are nice though._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

It's popular w/the late crowd._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0

The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great._1_0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place._0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty._1_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Never again!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But, they were too big for the bun._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also they were $15 each!_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too._0_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Seriously, this place kicks ass._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

I live in the neightborhood and am a regular._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It hits the spot every time_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants)._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've been many time and have never been disappointed._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!_0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!.._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sushi was awful!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Good, fast service._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would highly recommend._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food is great and inexpensive._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0

Jimmy is Dominican!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_1
Would NEVER go back there._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everything about this restaurant was special._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was attentive, yet discreet._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The flavors robust and subtle._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm saving up for my next visit._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The place was quiet and delightful._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service was good and food is wonderful._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way)._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_1_0_1
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
You can't go wrong with this place._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1_0
I LOVE their Thai_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I will go back to Suan soon!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I wish they would change back to what it was before._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food now is inconsistent._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The setting is casual and romantic._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Prices are very good._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The food is excellent!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative._0_0_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I was pleasantly suprised._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was exceptional._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices._0_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
i would just ask for no oil next time._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The fried dumplings are GREAT!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down._0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Never fails to please._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Service is fast and friendly._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But that is highly forgivable._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0

I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
You must try the shrimp appetizers._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house..._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0

If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A real dissapointment._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Priced at upper intermediate range._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
I really liked this place._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It was pretty inexpensive too._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table._0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0

Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhatten._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It just wasn't Thai._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Was surprisingly disappointed._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Pizza was a little soggy._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Not enough wines by the glass either._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
This place is a great bargain._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0

Faan is sooo good._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The best pad thai i've ever had._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The design and atmosphere is just as good._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
bottles of wine are cheap and good._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
What more could you want?_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was actually aweful._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0

The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Amazing!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food's as good as ever._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Can't wait to go back._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0

My roommate and I LOVE this place._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Indoor was very cozy and cute._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Staff is very accomodating._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But $1 for each small piece???_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Not worth it._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The decor is very simple but comfortable._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I loved it and would go again._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Everyone was more then happy with his choices._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great food and the prices are very reasonable._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices..._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Service is not what you are coming here for..._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need..._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Consistently good Japanese Tapas._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Always good drinks and service is pretty good;_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0

Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place._1_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit._1_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
No thanks!!!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!_1_0_1_1_0_1_1_0_1_0
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We were then shooed inside._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We left, never to return._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care._0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0

The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices._1_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
He offers subpar service and has no personality._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0

There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We got most of it back at home with us._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
No, really._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
