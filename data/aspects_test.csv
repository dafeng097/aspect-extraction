Overpriced and not tasty_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The food here was mediocre at best._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15...._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0

Excellent food, although the interior could use some help._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I paid just about $60 for a good meal, though :)_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0

The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food._1_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
There are no negatives to speak of._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low pirces._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
lobster was good, nothing spectacular._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
its just a fun place to go, not a five star restaraunt._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Way below average_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I'll be back for sure._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner._0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0

Too many other good places to have to settle._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed._1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Favorite Sushi in NYC_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming._1_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
SO GOOD_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ...)_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Come on._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Don't get me started on the margaritas, either._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The omlette for brunch is great..._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
the spinach is fresh, definately not frozen..._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
A weakness is the chicken in the salads._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Best Indian Restaurant in the City_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Best restaurant in Brooklyn_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is so romantic._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring)._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0

Ruth, mother of the Bride_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
would NOT go back._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!_1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1_0
$170 down the toilet..._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Good Experience_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
During our trip to NYC, we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu (offering a modified menu for $65 pp)._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
However, our main course was wonderful._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people._0_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_0_0
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order._0_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
over._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Impressed..._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Subtle food and service_1_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Great find in the West Village!_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Maggot in the food!_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling._0_1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Indo Chinese food, pretty good..._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Still we keep going back :)_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was speechless by the horrible food._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place survives on reputation alone._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I will NEVER return._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Everything on the menu is great._0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
This establishment is the real deal._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There is "Expensive-but-worth-it" and there is "Expensive-and-WTF"?_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Are you freaking kidding me?_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Look, the appetizers were really good._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The entree was also very good._1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced._1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
What you are paying for is the environment and the name._1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
$500 included:_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe._0_0_0_1_1_0_1_0_0_0

Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak._0_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0

Bison was quite excellent however._0_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0
Dessert: pure disaster._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Just not good at all._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I was wrong._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant"._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Yes, it is good, but I've had better for cheaper._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no._0_0_0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0
Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0

I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0
BUT not in a good way._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different._0_0_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The place is beautiful!_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The hostess was very pleasant._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Our experience did not ever get any better._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_1
We asked for beverages and never received them._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Don't go with a larger group than 4!_0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I went here for a family birthday dinner._1_0_0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The hostess said "Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which I replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please."_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us._0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each)._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food arrived in about 15 minutes._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice!_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I heard the lobster roll was excellent._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand)._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Service not the friendliest to our "large party"!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Probably would not go back here._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great Indian food_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Wretched and retching_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
For starters they delivered us someone else's order._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Fine, I wont hang you for that._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
None was made so i hung up._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
The nakgi-bokum was horrible._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
She just nodded and walked off._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We were charged full price._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Lives up to the hype_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It was well worth the wait._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The wife had the risotto which was amazing._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche._0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Terrible would be a compliment!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating._0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Stay away_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great Shabu Shabu_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I love it._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed._0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_1
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Restaurant with a view_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Celebrated my fathers birthday here._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food tasted very good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The family seafood entree was very good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The main entree was also very good._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We order a bit of everything on the menu._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
This place doesn't make any sense_1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional..._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work._1_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0
Good Food_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Over all it was a very nice romantic place ._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible)_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Loved it_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The atmosphere was great._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Maybe it has improved since then?_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Dumbfoundingly Poor_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn._0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention._0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Polite acknowledgement is out;_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
supercilious scorn is in._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious)._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
On that scale, it's a world-beater._0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
How is this palce still open?_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I honestly don't even know where to begin._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Everything was going good until we got our meals._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms._0_0_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away._0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!_1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore._1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The level of rudeness was preposterous._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED._0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Well...they can run but they can't hide._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
This place...god where do i begin._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great Hot Dogs!_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS)._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
But nonetheless--great spot, great food._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We live nearby BFC._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return._1_0_1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee._0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service._1_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first..._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
My family ate here last weekend._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant._1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert._0_0_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
If you go here, do it on his off-night._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Best meal in a long time!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Great Atmosphere_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

Poor service and management_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner._1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
Appetizers took nearly an hour._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Never got an explanation as to what was going on._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly._1_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
What a hassle!_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The food is very good, but not outstanding._0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff._0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I went there after hearing how great it was._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
Wow._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far._0_0_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_0

The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane._0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0
What?_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem._1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables._0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff._0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0
